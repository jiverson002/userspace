Welcome to userspace!
=====================

The computing resources at CSB/SJU have impressive potential. However, my
experience has been that these resources go underutilized due to lack of
information about how to use them. The **userspace** guide aims to fill this
gap, empowering students to harness the power of the Linux ecosystem at CSB/SJU.

How to use this guide
---------------------

This guide is organized around topics of interest to users of the CSB/SJU
computing resources. It is not meant to be read from beginning to end, but
rather as a desk reference, where knowledge about the campus systems can be
accumulated and quickly searched. That said, if there is a topic with which you
are unfamiliar, then by all means grab a cup of coffee and dive into the
documentation contained herein. As the guide evolves, material will be added
with more background and depth.
