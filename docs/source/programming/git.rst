Git
===

One of the most popular version control systems for software is Git. Git was
created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux kernel. Originally
utilized for the development of the Linux kernel, Junio Hamano is the current
maintainer of the project.

Many projects maintain their files in a Git repository, and sites like GitHub,
GitLab, and Bitbucket have made sharing and contributing to code simple,
valuable, and effective. Every working directory in Git is a full-fledged
repository with complete history and tracking independent of network access or a
central server.

Version control has become an indispensable tool in modern software development
because these systems allow you to keep track of software at the source level.
You and other members of a development team can track changes, revert to
previous stages, and branch off from the base code to create alternative
versions of files and directories.

Git is so useful for open-source projects because it facilitates the
contributions of many developers. Each contributor can branch off from the main
or master branch of the code base repository to isolate their own changes, and
can then make a pull request to have these changes integrated into the main
project.

The Git documentation is organized as follows:
